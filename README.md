Private DNS Quick Tile - toggle and configure your Private DNS settings on Android 9+ from the comfort of your quick settings panel.

This is a fork of [joshuawolfsohn/Private-DNS-Quick-Tile](https://github.com/joshuawolfsohn/Private-DNS-Quick-Tile) with changes to support newer versions of Android.

In order to change the Private DNS settings, this app requires the
`WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`` permission.

This permission can only be granted in an ADB shell with the command:
```
pm grant com.flashsphere.privatednsqs android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
```
